# Sentiment Spectrum using Voice Data
--------------------------------------
This was a a task assigned to me when I was applying for a ML Researcher Position and was asked to complete it in 2 hours.

1. I was given 5817 wav files and an excel sheet with file name and a y value that represents the sentiment whether it's angry/happy/sad/etc...
2. My approach was to use Fast Fourier Transform to extract features from my records and then train a traditional ML model like XGBOOST.

# NOTES: 
---------
1. Didn't perform Hyperparameter tuning as the time was so tight.
2. Didn't use traditional methods to extract the features like ffmpeg as the library didn't work and I didn't have the time to recognise the reason so I acted based upon what I have and what I can do right now BUT I got accepted for the next interview ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š.
